# About Monthly Reports

Welcome to Monthly Reports! This section tracks Project Bluefin's development activity, completed work, and contributor highlights from [todo.projectbluefin.io](https://todo.projectbluefin.io).

## What's in a report?

Each monthly report includes:

- **Completed work** from the project board (issues and pull requests moved to "Done")
- **Contributor highlights** recognizing everyone who contributed during the month
- **Focus areas** showing activity organized by project area (Desktop, Development, Ecosystem, Hardware, Infrastructure)

## Report Schedule

Reports are published automatically on the **first Monday of each month**

## Looking for OS releases?

These reports track project activity and development progress. For OS version updates, check out the [Changelogs](/changelogs) page. For announcements and deep dives, visit the [Blog](/blog).
