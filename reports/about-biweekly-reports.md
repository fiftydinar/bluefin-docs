# About Biweekly Reports

Welcome to Biweekly Reports! This section tracks Project Bluefin's development activity, completed work, and contributor highlights from [todo.projectbluefin.io](https://todo.projectbluefin.io).

## What's in a report?

Each biweekly report includes:

- **Completed work** from the project board (issues and pull requests moved to "Done")
- **Contributor highlights** recognizing everyone who contributed during the period
- **Categorized activity** organized by project area (features, bugs, docs, infrastructure, etc.)
- **Bot activity** showing automated updates and dependency maintenance

## Looking for OS releases?

These reports track **project activity and development progress**. For **OS release notes and version updates**, check out the [Changelogs](/changelogs) page.

Reports are published automatically every two weeks to keep the community informed about what we're working on.
