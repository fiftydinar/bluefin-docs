Happy Thanksgiving for those of you in the US eating dinosaurs! Today I am happy to show off some of the recent collaboration we've been doing with paleoartists. We've [covered this before](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/blog#welcome-to-bluefin) but now the collection is complete!

## Natalia Jagielska

Our newest collaboration is with [Dr. Natalia Jagielska](https://natalia-jagielska.weebly.com/), a world renowned expert [paleontologist](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/stunning-scottish-pterosaur-is-biggest-fossil-of-its-kind) and [paleoartist](https://natalia-jagielska.weebly.com/art.html)! I've always been a huge fan of her art style and she has graciously given us three wonderful pieces of art. The first you probably already recognize since it's been the wallpaper of the month for November, entitled _Collapse_:

The second is an homage to Ubuntu's [famous Hardy Heron wallpaper](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/04/focal-fossa-familiar-face-wallpaper), originally designed by Ken Wimer. This one is a mashup of one Natalia's pterosaurs in place of the heron. This one is called _Tenacious Pterosaur_.

And lastly we have _Prey_, starring a hungry [Venetoraptor gassenae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetoraptor), which is a pterosaur ancestor from the Triassic. This one surprised me, I thought it was a mammal at first!

All the wallpapers have a night version as well, so go check it out!

Natalia's artwork was vectorized and remastered by [Delphic Melody](https://ko-fi.com/melodyofdelphi), please consider donating so that the collaboration can continue!

## Andy Frazer (Dragon of Wales)

Original Bluefin artist Andy Frazer returns with _Dusk_. I love this one.

Also Andy is working on another Bluefin for us, which I haven't seen yet. I can't wait to find out!

## How to get them

This is not yet included by default so you can hop in early with a `ujust bbrew` and select `artwork`. In the future this will be automated for you:

![bbrew artwork selection](/img/blog/2025-11-27-bluefin-and-paleoartists/bbrew-screenshot.png)

`bluefin-wallpapers-extra` will bring this collection in. Also you will notice that the Aurora and Bazzite artwork collections are available. This tap is distro agnostic so go nuts putting dinosaurs, cone people, and mechs everywhere!

You can also just [grab them from the repository](https://github.com/ublue-os/artwork/tree/main/wallpapers) if you prefer to do it that way. Stay tuned for a special holiday wallpaper, coming soon!
