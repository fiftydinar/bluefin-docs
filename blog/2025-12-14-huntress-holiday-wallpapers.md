The holiday season brings new artwork to Bluefin and Aurora! We're excited to announce two beautiful new wallpapers: Andy Frazer's latest creation _Huntress_, and a festive holiday wallpaper for Aurora users.

## Huntress by Andy Frazer (Dragons of Wales)

Original Bluefin artist [Andy Frazer](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/dragonsofwales) returns with _Huntress_, a stunning new addition to our wallpaper collection. Following his previous work on _Dusk_, Andy continues to bring his distinctive paleoart style to Bluefin.
