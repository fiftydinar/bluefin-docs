Working with artists can be fun because they all move at different schedules so sometimes when it rains it pours. 

We're excited to announce two beautiful new wallpapers: Andy Frazer's latest creation _Huntress_, and a festive holiday wallpaper from Aurora. 

## Huntress by Andy Frazer (Dragons of Wales)

Original Bluefin artist [Andy Frazer](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/dragonsofwales) returns with _Huntress_, a stunning new addition to our wallpaper collection. Following his previous work on _Dusk_, Andy continues to bring his distinctive paleoart style to Bluefin. We were going for a more weathered Bluefin this time around. No longer the ideal one perched on a rock ... this one has been through some things.

Andy's books make excellent gifts for dinosaur enthusiasts of all ages. Check out his [Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/dragonsofwales) for his full collection of paleoart books and prints.

## Holiday Blues by Chandeleer

This next one is by [Chandeleer](https://ko-fi.com/chandeleer) and captures all of the mascots from Aurora, Bazzite, and Bluefin playing in the snow.
