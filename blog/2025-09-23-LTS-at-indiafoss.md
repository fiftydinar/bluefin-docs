I was thrilled at the opportunity to team up with [Pragyan Poudal](https://github.com/Johan-Liebert1) from Red Hat to showcase Bootc along with Bluefin's vision for desktop Linux to a packed house at IndiaFOSS 2025 in Bangalore this past weekend. I managed to make only a handful of Linux users mad. It was a great chance to spread the word about image-based bliss.
