**Key Achievement:** Transformed contributor sections from basic cards to polished, thematic, professional presentation with sponsor support

---

## Improvements Delivered (2026-01-28)

### 1. Fixed Contributor Duplicates ✅

**Problem:** Contributors appeared in both "New Contributors" and "Contributors" sections

**Root Cause:**

- New contributors weren't being filtered out of continuing contributors list
- Automatic `sponsorUrl` was being added to all contributors

**Solution:**

- Fixed filter logic in markdown generator to properly exclude new contributors
- Implemented selective `sponsorUrl` support based on curated list

**Files Modified:**

- `scripts/lib/markdown-generator.mjs` - Fixed duplicate filtering

**Impact:** Zero duplicates in all reports

### 2. Added GitHub Sponsors Support ✅

**Implementation:**

- Created centralized sponsor list from donations page
- Conditional `sponsorUrl` generation based on known sponsors
- Sponsor buttons only appear for contributors with active GitHub Sponsors

**Files Created:**

- `scripts/lib/github-sponsors.mjs` - Curated sponsor list (8 known sponsors)

**Files Modified:**

- `scripts/lib/markdown-generator.mjs` - Imports sponsor list, conditionally adds sponsorUrl

**Known Sponsors:**

- Current Maintainers: ahmedadan, castrojo, daegalus, hanthor, inffy, tulilirockz
- Maintainers Emeritus: KyleGospo, rothgar

**Impact:** 5 contributors in January 2026 report show sponsor buttons

### 3. Redesigned Contributor Badge Layout ✅

**Problem:**

- Badge positioned absolutely at bottom-left, overlapping with sponsor button
- Badge didn't look like a professional button
- Text alignment inconsistent
- Colorful emojis lacked polish

**Solution - Phase 1:**

- Created `.buttonRow` flex container for side-by-side layout
- Moved badge to inline flow with sponsor button
- Added gold gradient styling to sponsor buttons on highlighted cards

**Solution - Phase 2:**

- Changed to symbolic Unicode characters: `★` (star) and `♥` (heart)
- Added precise alignment properties:
  - `justify-content: center` - centers content
  - `line-height: 1` - crisp text rendering
  - `white-space: nowrap` - prevents wrapping
  - `min-height: 36px` - consistent button height
  - `vertical-align: middle` - proper vertical alignment

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/GitHubProfileCard.tsx` - Restructured JSX layout, button text
- `src/components/GitHubProfileCard.module.css` - Button row styling, perfect alignment

**Impact:** Professional, pixel-perfect button alignment matching donations page quality

### 4. Added Destiny 2 Guardian Theme ✅

**Implementation:**

- Section header: "New Contributors" → "New Lights"
- Button text: "⭐ New Contributor" → "★ New Light"
- Button text: "❤️ Sponsor" → "♥ Sponsor"
- New description: "We welcome our newest Guardians to the project."
- Added inspirational quotes from Destiny 2 characters

**Quotes Added:**

**New Lights Section:**

> "I do not know what the future holds. But I know this: with you at our side, there is nothing we cannot face."
>
> —Commander Zavala

**Contributors Section:**

> "Define yourself by your actions."
>
> —Lord Saladin

**Files Modified:**

- `scripts/lib/markdown-generator.mjs` - Updated headers, descriptions, quotes
- `src/components/GitHubProfileCard.tsx` - Changed badge text

**Impact:** Thematic consistency with Bluefin's Guardian/dinosaur lore, adds depth and personality to contributor recognition
