## Post-Launch Improvements

### PR #593: Historical Contributor Detection (2026-01-27)

**Problem Fixed:** Cumulative history file broke report regeneration

**Solution:** Query-based contributor detection relative to report date

**Changes:**

- Replaced `updateContributorHistory()` with `identifyNewContributors()`
- Added `fetchContributorsBeforeDate()` - queries GitHub history
- Enhanced bot patterns (pull, testpullapp)
- Consistent ChillOps for empty subsections
- Technical documentation: `.planning/technical-notes/contributor-detection-design.md`

**Impact:**

- Reports can now be regenerated accurately (idempotent)
- December 2025: 14 new contributors (corrected from 20)
- January 2026: 10 new contributors (corrected from 24)
- No overlap between months (verified)

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture

- **Multi-blog Docusaurus:** Separate `/reports` instance with RSS
- **Build-time data fetching:** Follows existing pattern (feeds, playlists, profiles)
- **GraphQL API integration:** Efficient Projects V2 queries with pagination
- **Historical tracking:** Query-based (regeneration-safe, no state file dependencies)
- **Bot filtering:** Regex-based with 7+ patterns
- **Label categorization:** Static mapping from projectbluefin/common

### Data Flow

```
Monthly (last day) → GitHub Actions workflow
  ↓
Fetch project board data (GraphQL)
  ↓
Filter merged PRs (exclude closed issues)
  ↓
Separate planned (common) vs opportunistic (other repos)
  ↓
Categorize by labels (area/*, kind/*)
  ↓
Query historical contributors (before report date)
  ↓
Identify new contributors
  ↓
Filter bots → aggregate activity
  ↓
Generate markdown (frontmatter + sections)
  ↓
Write reports/YYYY-MM-DD-report.mdx
  ↓
Git commit + push
  ↓
Deploy via GitHub Pages
```

### Innovation

1. **Query-based contributor detection** - First implementation of regeneration-safe contributor tracking
2. **Planned vs Opportunistic split** - Clear distinction between project board work and ad-hoc contributions
3. **Consistent ChillOps messaging** - Always show both subsections, indicate empty with ChillOps status
4. **Technical documentation** - Design notes capture architectural decisions for future reference
