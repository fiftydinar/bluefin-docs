Bluefin offers gaming tools [from Flathub](https://flathub.org/) to provide a gaming experience.

:::info[Is this any good for gamers?]

Most of the gaming experience depends on: An updated Linux kernel, updated MESA libraries, and updated firmware and other hardware enablement. Nvidia users need those drivers as well. All Universal Blue images deliver these critical components on a regular basis and are suitable for gaming. When those components are in place the performance in gaming tends to not differ much between other images and Linux distributions. It's all Linux.

Most of these tools can be found in the gaming section in the Bazaar app store:
