# User Metrics

Bluefin is a high performance predator, the team believes in the importance of instrumentation and telemetry as a means to improve software. However that information must be privacy respecting via an open process so that we can verify what information is being donated.

:::info[Note on ARM builds]

ARM devices are included in Bluefin LTS since that is the only Bluefin aarch64 image that currenty exists.

:::

The Fedora countme service is on by default in Fedora, and we inherit that behavior:

- [countme](https://github.com/wgwoods/fedora-countme-data)
- [How to turn it off](https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/countme/)

## Homebrew

Homebrew's analytics are on by default. To turn them off:

```
brew analytics off
```

Check the [homebrew documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics) for more information. You can also checkout the [operating system rankings](https://formulae.brew.sh/analytics/os-version/30d/) as a fun competition.

# Contributor Metrics

Since Bluefin is an [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org) image, it leverages the shared maintenance of a larger community. Note that builds are automated, long periods of inactivity are normal.
